# canvasShooter

Simple shooter game with JS on HTML5 canvas. The player is fixed in the center of the screen and gets attacked by enemies of various sizes. The objective is to point, shoot and kill these enemies with a mouse click / finger press. Bigger enemies need to be hit multiple times in order to destroy them. For every hit the player gains points, for every kill there will be a bonus.

The game is still in development, but is allready playable.

- small bugs. (disappearing enemies, game freezing)
- level up system (increase speed and/or number of enemies)
- topscore list for user (sessions/cookies)
- back-end for registering players and topscores
